<h2>What is scansreader</h2>
Scansreader is a "do the right thing" lean and mean unix/linux X C program to
read a set of images scanned from printed documents as confortably as
possible.

This page is at 
<a href='http://colas.nahaboo.net/software/scansreader'>http://colas.nahaboo.net/software/scansreader</a>

<h3>Goals</h3>
Scansreader was done to:
<ul>
<li><b>Be safe</b>, with no functionality to accidentaly modify or delete the images on disk.
<li><b>Be usable</b>, with only adapted functionalities for the task (no
		window mode, only fullscreen full width mode), with streamlined
		interaction (scroll only vertically, without clicking the
		mouse), automatic bookmarks in unlimited numbers.
<li><b>Be fast</b> pure C, based on the fast 
<a href='http://www.klografx.net/qiv/'>QIV</a>
general image viewer, with added prefetching of next image.
</ul>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
I could not find a program satisfying these criteria. All involved too much
	    interaction or option-setting to really read scans as painlessly
	    as a real book.
<p>
I stumbled on a nice and fast linux image viewer
<a href='http://www.klografx.net/qiv/'>QIV</a> by Adam Kopacz, and decided to
use it as the base for scansreader, removing a lot of its code
and adding functionalities. It makes use of the X, gdk and imlib libraries.

<h3>License</h3>
Pure Open source: <a href='http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html'>GPL</a>

<h2>More details</h2>
See the <a href='README.txt'>README</a> text file, the 
<a href='HISTORY.txt'>HISTORY</a> of versions, and the
<a href='scansreader-manual.txt'>Manual</a> page.
You can be
<a href='http://changedetection.com/detect.html?url=http://colas.nahaboo.net/software/scansreader'>mailed of new versions</a>

<h2>Download</h2>
Download the last version in the 
<a href='http://colas.nahaboo.net/software/scansreader/files'>files</a>
directory. Included in the distrib is also a precompiled executable, 
in normal (scansreader) and statically linked (scansreader-static) versions.
 Just copy it in your path, e.g. in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>. 

<td valign=top class=right width="43%">
<h2>User manual</h2> 

	    Just run <tt>scansreader</tt>. it will read all the images in the
	    current directory, (or the directory or zip, cbz, rar or cbr
	    archive given as argument), and open the first one full screen,
	    resized to the full width of the screen.
<ul><li>the <b>-l</b> option will re-open the last document that was opened
		the last time we quit the program.
<li><b>-L fr</b> will use the French language for online help texts.
<li><b>--help</b> prints the full usage, with more options
</ul>

Then, you can read your document with the following commands:
<ul>

<li><b>moving the mouse</b> will scroll the document, as <b>using the
mousewheel</b>, or pressing the <b>up / down arrow</b> keys will only scroll
vertically, and stop at the top and bottom of the image, indicating the end
with a small yellow triangle at the bottom right or top left of the image.

<li><b>SPACE</b> will "do the right thing": move down the image, then go to
the next one once at the bottom. If the image has been zoomed in, ans is wider
than the screen, goes first to the right then down to the left, etc...  

<li><b>left-click</b> or <b>right arrow</b> key will go to next page,
<li><b>right-click</b> or <b>left arrow</b> key will go to next page,

<li><b>q</b> or <b>Escape</b> will quit, appending the current position to the
		<tt>~/.scansreader.log</tt> file
<li><b>p</b> and <b>n</b> will go to the previous or next saved place
<li><b>1,2,...,9,0</b> Goes to image at 0, 10, 20, ..., 90, 100% of currenbt
		    set.
<li><b>?</b> (or any other non-understood key) displays online help, with more
		    commands
</ul>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

When reading a book, I do not want to be bothered having to get to the mouse
or touchpad, especially when potatio-couching with my notebook, and have to
aim for menus, scrollbars, buttons. Thus scansreader do not use any of this
interaction method, and is always fullscreen.

<p> It also do not provide things that belong to generic image manipulation
programs like the gimp: no thumbnails, no 2-page mode, no dialog box to open
files (you just run scansreader via your favorite desktop program).

<p>Why Scan<b>s</b>reader? there was no google hit with scansreader, but
scanreader was already the name of many products.
